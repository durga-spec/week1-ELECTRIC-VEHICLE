# ⚡ Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Prediction Project  

### 🗓️ Week 1 Submission — Dataset & Problem Definition  
____

## 🚘 Project Overview  
This project aims to **predict the sales of Electric Vehicles (EVs)** using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
The goal is to understand the **factors influencing EV adoption and future market trends** through data analysis and model building.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Define a clear **problem statement** related to EV sales.  
- **Collect and preprocess** the EV dataset.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights.  
- Prepare the dataset for future machine-learning model training.

---

## 💡 Theme — Electric Vehicles  
Contributing to **sustainable mobility** by leveraging **data-driven insights** to forecast EV sales and promote clean energy adoption.

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals  
- Understand how **machine learning** can be used for forecasting.  
- Learn to handle and analyze data in **Jupyter Notebook**.  
- Explore **AI APIs** such as OpenAI, DALL·E, Gemini, and DeepSeek for chatbot or visual insights.  
- Use the **Streamlit framework** to build an interactive project frontend.
